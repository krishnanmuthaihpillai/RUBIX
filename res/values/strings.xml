    <string name="praragraph"> \t This agreement ("Agreement") forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in 
      relation to your use of the Store to distribute Products. You acknowledge that Google will, 
      solely on your behalf, and not on Googleâ€™s behalf, display and make Products available for 
      download and purchase by users. In order to use the Store to distribute Products, you must 
      accept this Agreement and provide complete and accurate information in the Developer Console.
      You may not distribute Products on the Store if you do not accept this Agreement.\n \n
    You may not use the Store to distribute Products and may not accept the Agreement unless you
    are verified as a Developer in good standing. This Agreement will automatically terminate if you
    are (a) not a Developer in good standing, or (b) a person or entity that is barred from using
    Android software under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the country
    in which you are a resident or from which you use the Android software.\n \n

    If you agree to be bound by this Agreement on behalf of your employer or any other entity,
    you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such 
    entity to this Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not accept
    the Agreement or use the Store on behalf of your employer or any other entity. \n\n

    This Agreement covers both Products you choose to distribute for free and Products
    for which you charge a fee. In order to charge a fee for your Products, you must have
    a valid Payment Account under a separate agreement with a Payment Processor. 
    If you have an existing Payment Account with a Payment Processor before signing up for the
    Store, then the terms of that agreement will apply except in the event of a conflict with 
    this Agreement (in which case the terms of this Agreement shall apply).\n\n

    Products are displayed to users on your behalf, at prices you establish at your sole 
    discretion. Google may include applicable taxes in the price charged to users on the Store.
    You may set the price for your Products in the currencies permitted by the Payment Processor.
    Google may display the price of Products to users in their native currency, but it is not
    responsible for the accuracy of currency rates or currency conversion.\n\n

    You are the merchant of record for Products you sell through the Store. The price you set
    for Products will determine the amount of payment you will receive. A Transaction Fee, 
    as defined below, will be charged on the sales price and apportioned to the Payment Processor 
    and, if one exists, the Authorised Operator. Where either Google, the Payment Processor or the
    Authorised Carrier are required by applicable (local) legislation to withhold any taxes
    ("Withholding Taxes") on payments made or received by anyone of them, Google will also 
    deduct an amount equal to such Withholding Taxes from the sales price. For the avoidance 
    of doubt, Withholding Taxes include, but are not limited to, withholding tax obligations 
    on cross-border payments or imposed by telecommunications taxes. The remainder 
    (sales price less Transaction Fee, and less the amount equal to any Withholding Taxes) 
    will be remitted to you. The "Transaction Fee" is set forth here and may be revised by
    Google from time to time. You are responsible for providing any applicable tax residency 
    certificates to Google. If Google or its service provider does not receive such documentation,
    Google will withhold at the domestic withholding tax rate.\n\n

   Developer is responsible for determining if a Product is taxable and the applicable
   tax rate for the Payment Processor to collect for each taxing jurisdiction where Products 
   are sold. The Developer is responsible for remitting taxes to the appropriate taxing authority.
   Where Google, the Payment Processor or the Authorised Carrier is required by applicable (local)
   legislation to determine, apply and pay the applicable tax rate, Google, the Payment Processor
   or the Authorised Carrier (and not Developer) will be responsible for applying and collecting
   and remitting the taxes to the appropriate taxing authority. If Google collects and remits 
   value added taxes on customer payments (where required of Google by applicable local law)
   and this remittance fulfils the applicable requirements for value added taxes on those 
   customer payments, such taxes will not be passed on to Developer by Google.
   Where Google is required to collect and remit taxes as described in this section,
   Developer and Google will recognise a supply from Developer to Google for tax purposes,
   and developer will comply with the relevant tax obligations arising from this additional
   supply.\n\n

    You may also choose to distribute Products for free. If the Product is free, 
    you will not be charged a Transaction Fee. You may not start charging a user for a Product that 
    was initially free unless the charge correlates with an alternative version of the Product.
    The Payment Processor must process all fees a Developer receives for any version of a
    Product distributed via the Store.\n\n

    You Support Your Product. Buyers are instructed to contact the developer concerning any defects
    or performance issues in applications downloaded and installed from Google Play. You will be 
    solely responsible for, and Google will have no responsibility to undertake or handle, support
    and maintenance of your Products and any complaints about your Products. You must supply and 
    maintain valid and accurate contact information that will be displayed in each application 
    detail page on the Store and made available to users for customer support and legal purposes.
    For paid Products or in-app transactions, you must respond to customer support inquiries
    within three (3) working days, and within 24 hours to any support or Product concerns 
    stated to be urgent by Google. Failure to provide adequate information or support for
    your Products may result in low Product ratings, less prominent product exposure, 
    low sales, billing disputes, or removal from the Store.  </string>
